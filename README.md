# PHP File explorer

A file explorer for a website in PHP, protected by credentials (a username and a password).

## How to test

To test the website, launch an integrated php server with : `php -S localhost:8000 -t public`

## How to connect 

The default username is _admin_ and the default password is _admin_. It is hard coded in the source files (even so it is encripted)

## Security warning

I'm not an expert in security and connection might be unsafe, let me know.
